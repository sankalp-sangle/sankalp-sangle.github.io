          I am an incoming graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology! Earlier, I was a
          software engineer at Cisco Systems, Bengaluru. <br />I was
          brought up in the historic city of Pune, erstwhile Poona, a bustling
          metro in Maharashtra, India.
          <br />
          I love meddling with all things Computer Science, distributed systems,
          Chess, and Football!

              I conducted my undergraduate thesis on detecting data center faults using network visualization
              at the Systems and Networking group under Professor Chan Mun Choon. Singapore is a fantastic place,
              and my only regret is getting just a little over 2 months to explore it before CoViD struck üôÅ.

              I worked on Firewall health monitoring and alerts as an intern in Summer 2019! I am extremely proud that my
              work went into production with Health and Monitoring now a feature of Cisco's Next-Gen Firewalls.
              It was a bittersweet summer as Arsenal lost the Europa League final. Still, Cisco and Bengaluru were brilliant to me,
               and I converted my internship into a full-time offer!

              I spent 4 memorable years at Birla
              Institute of Technology and Science, a premier engineering college
              in picturesque Pilani! At BITS, I was the coordinator of the Department of
              Stage Controls, a body responsible for planning and logistics of Auditorium events during Oasis.
              I was also a member of ACM, BITS Pilani chapter, and the college football team.<br>
              A few lines are not enough to show my gratitude, but I came here looking for Copper, and I found Gold.
