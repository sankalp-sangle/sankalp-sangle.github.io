              I conducted my undergraduate thesis on detecting data center faults using network visualization
              at the Systems and Networking group under Professor Chan Mun Choon. Singapore is an amazing place

              I worked on Firewall health monitoring and alerts as an intern in Summer 2019! I am extremely proud that my
              work went into production with Health and Monitoring now a full fledged team at the division.
              It was a bittersweet summer as Arsenal lost the Europa League final but Cisco and Bangalore were brilliant to me,
               and I converted my internship into a full time offer!

              I spent some of the most memorable years of my life at Birla
              Institute of Technology and Science, a premier engineering college
              in picturesque Pilani! At BITS, I was the coordinator of the Department of
              Stage Controls, a body responsible for planning and logistics of Auditorium events during Oasis.
              I was also a member of ACM, BITS Pilani chapter and the college football team.<br>
              A few lines are not enough to show my gratitude, but I came here looking for Copper, and I found Gold.

              Bishop's, along with BITS, has had the biggest contribution in shaping me into who I am today. <br>
